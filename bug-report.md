**Environment:** Production/Development

## Bug #1: Navigation Logo Functionality Issue

### **Priority:** Medium
### **Status:** Open
### **Severity:** Moderate

#### **Issue Summary**
The top-left logo/home button is not functioning as expected when clicked. The logo should return users to the top of the page, but currently has inconsistent behavior.

#### **Expected Behavior**
- Clicking the clear.ai logo should smoothly scroll the user to the top of the current page
- Logo should provide immediate visual feedback on interaction
- Navigation should be consistent across all pages

#### **Current Behavior**
- Logo click triggers a page reload instead of smooth scrolling
- Causes unnecessary page refresh which disrupts user experience
- May cause loss of form data or current page state

#### **Affected Components**
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` (lines 85-100)
- Logo click handler implementation

#### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Navigate to any page on the website
2. Scroll down to any section (About, Services, Contact)
3. Click on the "clear.ai" logo in the top-left corner
4. Observe the behavior

#### **Technical Details**
```javascript
// Current problematic implementation:
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  onNavigate('home');
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.reload(); // This causes page reload
  }, 50);
}}
```

#### **Recommended Fix**
Replace page reload with smooth scroll to top:
```javascript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  onNavigate('home');
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
}}
```

#### **Browser Compatibility**
- **Tested Browsers:** Chrome 120+, Firefox 121+, Safari 17+
- **Issue Present:** All tested browsers

## Bug #2: Chatbot Placeholder Visibility Issue

### **Priority:** High
### **Status:** Open
### **Severity:** Major

#### **Issue Summary**
The chatbot placeholder element is not visible to users, despite being present in the code. This affects the planned user experience and future chatbot integration.

#### **Expected Behavior**
- Chatbot placeholder should be visible as a floating element
- Should indicate future chatbot functionality to users
- Should maintain consistent positioning across all pages

#### **Current Behavior**
- Placeholder exists only as HTML comments
- No visual representation for users
- Missing UI element that was planned for the interface

#### **Affected Components**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 530-560)
- Chatbot integration section

#### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Load any page of the website
2. Look for chatbot placeholder in bottom-right corner
3. Observe that no placeholder element is visible
4. Check browser developer tools to confirm comment-only implementation

#### **Technical Details**
```javascript
// Current implementation (comments only):
{/* 
  CHATBOT AGENT INTEGRATION PLACEHOLDER
  TODO: Implement ChatbotAgent component and import here
  // <ChatbotAgent />
*/}
```

#### **Root Cause**
The placeholder is implemented as HTML comments rather than visible UI elements, making it invisible to end users.

#### **Recommended Fix**
Implement a visible placeholder component:
```jsx
{/* Chatbot Placeholder - Visible to users */}
<div className="fixed bottom-8 right-8 z-50">
  <div className="bg-gray-800/90 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full p-4 border border-purple-500/30 shadow-lg">
    <MessageCircle className="h-6 w-6 text-purple-400" />
    <span className="sr-only">Chatbot coming soon</span>
  </div>
</div>
```
